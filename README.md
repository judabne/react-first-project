# react-first-project
I am doing this project to exercise my React skills. It is simple and basic.
While so far this is a demo project, I plan to keep adding features so one can build upon it.
Therefore, if you would like to bring up issues or work with me on them, feel welcome!

So far I've created a messaging page, a method to add posts to the site, and transitions between different views.

To be added:
- Validation
- Infinite scrolling
